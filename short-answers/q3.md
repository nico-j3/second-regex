# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
 \b is related to word boundaries, while \s is related to whitespace characters.

Basically! Boundaries (`\b`) and white space (`\s`) can be used to denote the end of a word, but `\b` doesn't include itself. `\sok\s` would match `" ok "`, but `\bok\b` would just match `"ok"`. That can be useful when using `.match` to pick out words.
